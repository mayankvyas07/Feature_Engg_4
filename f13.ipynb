    "Q1. Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format, but they differ in the type of categorical data they are suitable for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "Label Encoding is a technique where each unique category in a categorical variable is assigned a unique integer label. The order of the labels does not hold any specific meaning or hierarchy. Label Encoding is used for nominal categorical data, where the categories do not have an inherent order.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of car sizes with categories: \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" Using Label Encoding, we would assign the following integer labels: \"Small\" -> 0, \"Medium\" -> 1, \"Large\" -> 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or ranking among the categories. The categories are assigned integer labels based on their order, preserving the ordinal relationship between them.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of education levels with categories: \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD.\" Using Ordinal Encoding, we would assign the following integer labels based on their ranking: \"High School\" -> 1, \"Bachelor's\" -> 2, \"Master's\" -> 3, \"PhD\" -> 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "You would choose Label Encoding when dealing with nominal categorical data, where there is no inherent order among the categories. On the other hand, you would choose Ordinal Encoding when dealing with ordinal categorical data, where the categories have a meaningful order or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for ordinal encoding, where the labels are assigned based on the target variable's relationship with the categorical variable. It involves calculating the mean of the target variable for each category and then ordering the categories based on their mean value. This way, the encoding is guided by the target variable, making it more informative for predictive modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of when to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of car prices with a categorical variable \"Car Brand,\" and you want to predict car prices based on the brand. By using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you can assign integer labels to the car brands based on their average price. This will create an ordinal relationship among the brands based on their average price, potentially making the encoding more informative for predicting car prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Covariance and its importance in statistical analysis:\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction (positive or negative) and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. In other words, covariance measures how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of covariance in statistical analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship between variables: Covariance helps in understanding whether two variables move in the same direction (positive covariance) or opposite directions (negative covariance).\n",
    "Portfolio diversification: In finance, covariance is used to understand the relationship between different assets in a portfolio. Low or negative covariance between assets indicates diversification potential, reducing overall risk.\n",
    "Feature selection: In machine learning, covariance can be used to identify redundant or highly correlated features, helping in feature selection and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "Calculation of covariance:\n",
    "For two variables X and Y with n data points, the covariance (cov) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = Î£ [(X_i - mean(X)) * (Y_i - mean(Y))] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Label Encoding using scikit-learn for categorical variables:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",

    "Encoded Size: [1 2 0 2 1]\n",
    "Encoded Material: [2 1 0 0 1]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The Label Encoder assigns unique integer labels to each category in the categorical variables. For example, \"red\" is encoded as 2, \"green\" as 1, and \"blue\" as 0 in the \"color\" variable. Similarly, \"small\" is encoded as 1, \"medium\" as 2, and \"large\" as 0 in the \"size\" variable. The same process is applied to the \"material\" variable.\n",
